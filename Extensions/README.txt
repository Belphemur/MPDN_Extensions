MPDN Extensions README
======================

MPDN Extensions are distributed in two formats - binary version (also via 
installer) or source version.

These binaries are built from LGPL v3.0 source codes available on GitHub: 
https://github.com/zachsaw/MPDN_Extensions

For end-users, the binary version is the preferred choice as MPDN starts faster
and it has contains version info that can be used to check for updates 
automatically.

If you want to change the way the extensions behave, or found a patch online 
you want to apply, or you simply want to poke around to see what you can learn,
you should download the source version from GitHub. To use it, simply delete 
all the files and folders in the Extensions folder and replace them with the 
source codes.
